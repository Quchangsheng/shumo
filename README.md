It's the code for Batch Optimization Problem of Square Parts (Huawei).

Layout Problem: By using a 3E layout generation algorithm based on a value iteration framework, the model is solved by iteratively
optimizing the value of the sheet and the selection order.

Group Batch Problemï¼šThe solution model of iterative optimization method for order group batch and nesting problem is proposed,
which considers the strong coupling relationship between order group batch and nesting optimization. This method allows the layout
results of each batch to provide feedback and adjust the generation of the next batch, continuously optimizing the batching process.
